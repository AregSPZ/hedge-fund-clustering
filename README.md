# Clustering of Hedge Funds
This project analyzes a dataset of the top 100 global hedge funds in 2020. It uses data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques to identify patterns and insights in the data. The project also includes visualizations to aid in understanding the results.

# Model Description
The model performs dimensionality reduction on preprocessed data to make the results of clustering more intrepretable and speed up the training by reducing noise.

# Goal
The primary goal is to identify significant patterns and insights within the hedge fund data to facilitate better understanding and decision-making.

# Models Used
Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Dimensionality Reduction: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (scikit-learn's t-SNE) to make the non-linear data 2 dimensional while retaining important information.
Clustering: K-means to group similar hedge funds together based on their characteristics.

# Results
The project includes visualizations that highlight the patterns and insights derived from the clustering analysis.
